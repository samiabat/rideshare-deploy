# Rideshare
ASP .NET Web API Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of an ASP .NET Web API, which serves as a backend solution for a web application. The API provides a set of endpoints that allow clients to interact with the application's data and services. It follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) and provides a scalable and flexible architecture for building web services.

## Features

- **API Endpoints**: The project includes a set of well-defined API endpoints that handle various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and provide access to the application's resources and functionalities.

- **Data Models and Persistence**: The API defines data models that represent the entities in the application's domain. It also includes mechanisms for persisting and retrieving data from a database or other data storage systems.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: The project incorporates authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints and control access to protected resources. It supports various authentication methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, or API keys.

- **Validation and Error Handling**: The API implements input validation to ensure data integrity and provides appropriate error responses when invalid requests are made. It handles exceptions and errors gracefully to provide a smooth user experience.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: The project includes logging mechanisms to capture relevant information and track the API's performance. It may utilize tools like Serilog, NLog, or the built-in logging capabilities of ASP .NET to record logs and monitor the system.

- **Documentation**: The API is well-documented, providing detailed information about its endpoints, request/response formats, and any additional features or requirements. Documentation may be generated using tools like Swagger or provided in a separate document (e.g., OpenAPI specification).

## Getting Started

To run the ASP .NET Web API project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project source code.

2. Ensure that you have the necessary software dependencies installed, including the .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK.

3. Set up the project's configuration files, including connection strings, authentication settings, and other environment-specific variables.

4. Open the project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

5. Build the project and resolve any missing dependencies or build errors.

6. Run the API project, which will start a local development server hosting the API endpoints.

7. Test the API using a tool like Postman or by accessing the endpoints directly from a client application.
